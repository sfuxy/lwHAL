\subsection{STM32F4xx}
We tested the lwHAL on the STM NUCLEO-F429ZI development board. The test consists
in turning the red LED on and then toggling at every second the green LED on the board.

We initialized a new project for the NUCLEO-F429ZI from the STM IDE, setting
with default configuration. Then we added the lwHAL folder inside the $/Core$, as
shown in figure \ref{fig:stm_ide}.
The $\#define$ $STM32F4xx$ must be uncommented in the $src/config.h$.
Make sure to include the path to the lwHAL folder inside the IDE.

Copy the code snippets from the
$ports/stm32f4/stm32f4\_test.c$
into the $main.c$.
Compile and run the binary on the board. You will see the red LED turning on and
the green LED blinking at a frequency of 1 Hz.
